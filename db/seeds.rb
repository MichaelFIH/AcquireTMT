# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.

# --- Comparable-transaction benchmarks (powers CompsEngine) ------------------
#
# Multiples are real, sourced 2025 figures from free public broker/marketplace
# data (see `source` per sector). The individual businesses are representative
# at SMB scale (kind: "benchmark"); for each sector we generate a spread of
# sizes so the engine can match by revenue band and compute real medians.
# Idempotent: rebuilds the benchmark rows on every run, leaving any manually
# entered "transaction" rows untouched.
